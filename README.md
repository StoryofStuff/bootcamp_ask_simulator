## Ask Simulator

This is an ask simulator that allows people to ask questions and get answers (some good, some bad). Think of it like a hybrid between a turing machine, a magic eight-ball, and a verbal sparring partner.

## Models

#### Questions

Questions start out as a simple text field associated with a user. (Or, in the future, they might be able to be texted in!). Upon submission they are reviewed and assigned an answer.

###StwPrefill

 The Spread the Word unit comes with prefill options which are a set of pre-populated answers.

## ToDo

#### AJAX-ey wait

When someone sends a message there should be a brief pause during which panic dots appear on the screen. Sounds like a job for AJAX and JS.

This repo will now be expanded to include other modules and a framework to connect them.
