Ask Simulator
=============
This is an ask simulator that allows people to ask questions and get answers (some good, some bad). Think of it like a hybrid between a turing machine, a magic eight-ball, and a verbal sparring partner.

Questions
---------
 Questions start out as a simple text field associated with a user. (Or, in the future, they might be able to be texted in!). Upon submission they are reviewed and assigned an answer.
